Winning condition:
Take all the pieces of the other player that are not located on the 'o' tile or if the opponent resigns (AKA rage quit).

Rules:
   Similar to chess, two colors, red side always starts first.
   The rounds alternate between the two players.
   On each round, the player can choose to either get a new piece or move an exsisting piece.
   The movement restrictions for each piece are shown with green markers.

   If the player chooses to get a new piece, the new piece is added to the 'o' tile on the player's side.
   You can do this a maximum of five times.
